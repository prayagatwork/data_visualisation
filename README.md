# data_visualisation
using python

Data Loading: The code uses the pandas library to read data from an Excel file named "data.xlsx."
Data Extraction: It extracts two columns, "X" and "Y," from the Excel data and converts them into NumPy arrays for further processing.
Plot Creation: The code utilizes matplotlib to create a simple line plot of the data, with "X" values on the x-axis and "Y" values on the y-axis. A legend, labels, and a grid are added to enhance the plot.
Visualization: After configuring the plot, it is displayed using plt.show(), allowing for easy visualization of the data.
Customization: The code is easily adaptable to work with different Excel files and can be customized for various types of plots by modifying labels, titles, colors, and other plot attributes.
